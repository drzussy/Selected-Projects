# My Selected Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing various projects I worked on during my first year of school. This repository demonstrates my skills and expertise in Python, C, and C++ across different domains, including web scraping, user interface (UI) development, object-oriented programming (OOP), memory management, and more.

## Python Projects





### Project 1 - Image Processing

- **Description**: This project explores various image processing techniques using Python.

### Project 2 - Search Engine

- **Description**: The Search Engine project involves building a search engine in Python using web scraping techniques. It includes crawling web pages, extracting data, indexing content, and providing search functionality.
### Project 2 - Rush-Hour Game

- **Description**: In this project, I implemented the Rush Hour puzzle game in Python using OOP principles. The Rush Hour game involves sliding blocks to free a specific vehicle and solve the puzzle. Designing classes for game elements and solving algorithms to find optimal moves are key aspects of this project.
### Project 4 - Boggle Game

- **Description**: This project features a Boggle game implemented in Python, complete with a graphical user interface (GUI) and game logic implemented using OOP principles. The game employs backtracking algorithms to find valid words on the Boggle board.

## C Projects

### Project 5A - C Prediction Algorithm (Markov Chain)

- **Description**: This project implements a prediction algorithm in C, utilizing a Markov chain data structure. The goal is to generate new tweets or text based on a bank of supplied tweets or text data.
### Project 5B - Generic C Prediction Algorithm

- **Description**: Similar to Project 5A, this project implements a prediction algorithm in C. However, this version is designed to be more generic and applicable to various types of input data beyond just text. It showcases the use of generic programming concepts in C.

## C++ Project

### Project 6 - Neural Network for Handwritten Numbers

- **Description**: Project 6 involves implementing a neural network in C++ to process handwritten numbers. The neural network is trained on a dataset of handwritten digits and can recognize and classify the numbers with a high degree of accuracy (up to 97%). This project demonstrates machine learning and pattern recognition.

Each project directory contains detailed documentation and code, making it easy for others to understand and use the work effectively. Feel free to explore these projects and learn more about my skills and capabilities in Python, C, and C++.
