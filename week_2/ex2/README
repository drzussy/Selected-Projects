# Week 2: Introduction to Loops and Control Structures

Welcome to Week 2 of the "Introduction to Computer Science" course project! In this week's module, we explored various coding concepts related to loops, control structures, and basic conditionals. Below, you'll find a summary of the code and topics covered in Week 2.

## Code Overview

### `largest_and_smallest.py`

This script contains a function `largest_and_smallest` that takes three values and returns the largest and smallest among them. It also includes a testing function `check_largest_and_smallest` to verify the correctness of the code.

### `quadratic_equations.py`

This script provides functions for solving quadratic equations. It includes `quadratic_equation`, which calculates the roots of a quadratic equation, and `quadratic_equation_user_input`, which allows users to input coefficients to find the roots.

### `shapes.py`

This script implements a basic shape area calculator. Users can choose between calculating the area of a circle, rectangle, or triangle and input the necessary values for calculation.

### `temperature.py`

The `temperature.py` script checks the safety conditions on the fictional planet Vormir based on temperature readings over three days. It defines the function `is_vormir_safe` to make this determination.

## How to Use

Each script can be executed individually by running the Python file in your terminal or IDE. For example, to run `largest_and_smallest.py`, use the following command:

```bash
python largest_and_smallest.py
