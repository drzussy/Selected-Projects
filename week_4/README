# Week 4: Battleship Game Implementation

Welcome to Week 4 of the "Introduction to Computer Science" course! In this week's assignment, you'll be implementing the classic game of Battleship using Python. Below, you'll find an overview of the code and its functionalities.

## Code Overview

The `week4.py` file contains the implementation of the Battleship game. Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionalities:

### Game Initialization

- `create_player_board(rows, columns, ship_sizes)`: This function initializes the player's game board and prompts the player to place their ships on the board. It ensures that the ship placements are valid.

- `create_computer_board(rows, columns, ship_sizes)`: This function initializes the computer's game board, randomly places its ships, and ensures that the placements are valid.

### Gameplay

- `get_torpedo_coordinates()`: This function prompts the player to enter coordinates for firing torpedoes, validates the input, and returns the chosen target coordinates.

- `fire_torpedo(board, loc)`: This function receives firing coordinates and updates the game board based on the outcome of the shot. It handles hits on ships and updates the board accordingly.

### Win Condition

- `check_win(board1, board2)`: This function checks whether there is a winner in the game. It determines if all ships on either the player's or computer's board have been sunk.

### Main Game Loop

- `main()`: The `main` function controls the main game loop. It alternates between the player's and computer's turns, checks for a winner, and prompts the player to play again or exit.

### Importing `helper.py`

The code imports a `helper.py` file, which provides essential helper functions and constants for board management, input handling, and randomization. The `helper.py` file is not authored by me but is supplied by the course instructors to assist with the game implementation.

Please note that the code provided in `week4.py` is a simplified version of the Battleship game, and you are encouraged to explore and enhance it further as you see fit.

## Running the Game

To run the Battleship game, execute the `week4.py` script. Follow the on-screen instructions to place your ships and take turns firing torpedoes at the computer's fleet. The game will announce the winner and ask if you'd like to play another round.

Feel free to experiment with different strategies, and have fun playing Battleship!

## Acknowledgment

The `helper.py` file, imported in this code, provides crucial functionalities for the game and was supplied by the course instructors. It plays a significant role in simplifying and enhancing the gameplay experience.

Happy gaming!
