# Week 6 - Web Scraping and Search Engines: Final Project

Hello, fellow learners! Welcome to the final project for Week 6 of our Intro to Computer Science course. In this project, we'll be exploring the exciting realms of web scraping and building a basic search engine. I'll walk you through our code implementation and provide explanations for each function.

## Getting Started

Before we dive into the project, make sure you have the necessary tools and libraries installed. We'll be using Python, so ensure you have packages like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` ready to go:

```bash
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

## Web Scraping

### What Is Web Scraping?
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves making HTTP requests to web pages, parsing the HTML content, and then extracting specific information.

## Search Engines

### Introduction to Search Engines
Search engines are essential tools for finding information on the web. We'll explore the principles behind search engines, including crawling and indexing web content, ranking search results, and implementing custom search engines.

## Code Implementation

Now, let's dive into the heart of the projectâ€”the code! We have two main scripts, `web_scraping.py` and `search_engine.py`, each serving a distinct purpose.

### Web Scraping Code (`web_scraping.py`)
- `make_http_request(url)`: Makes an HTTP request to a given URL and returns the HTML content.
- `parse_html(html)`: Parses HTML content using BeautifulSoup and returns the parsed data.
- `extract_data(data)`: Extracts specific data from the parsed HTML.
- `handle_data_formats(data)`: Handles different data formats, such as JSON or XML.
- `web_scraping_main(url)`: The main function that orchestrates the entire web scraping process.

### Search Engine Code (`search_engine.py`)
- `crawl_and_index_web_content(url)`: Simulates the crawling and indexing process of web content.
- `implement_ranking_algorithm(results)`: Implements ranking algorithms to determine result relevance.
- `build_basic_search_engine(query)`: Creates a basic search engine based on indexed data and ranking.
- `customize_search_engine(customization)`: Discusses customizing search engines for specific use cases.
- `search_engine_main(query)`: The main function that handles search engine operations.

## Function Explanations

Let's delve deeper into the functions within our code.

### `make_http_request(url)`
This function makes an HTTP request to a given URL using the `requests` library and returns the HTML content of the web page.

### `parse_html(html)`
Using BeautifulSoup, this function parses the HTML content, making it easy to navigate and search the HTML tree structure.

### `extract_data(data)`
We use this function to locate specific HTML elements (e.g., tags, attributes) containing the data we want to extract and process it as needed.

### `handle_data_formats(data)`
Web pages can contain data in various formats. This function gracefully handles different data formats, such as JSON or XML.

### `crawl_and_index_web_content(url)`
This function simulates the process of crawling and indexing web content. It visits web pages, extracts relevant information, and indexes it for later retrieval.

### `implement_ranking_algorithm(results)`
Our code implements ranking algorithms to determine the relevance of web pages to a given search query. Page ranking is crucial for presenting search results in a meaningful order.

### `build_basic_search_engine(query)`
This function creates a basic search engine. It takes a query and returns relevant search results based on the indexed data and ranking.

### `customize_search_engine(customization)`
Here, we discuss how search engines can be customized for specific purposes, such as focusing on particular domains or topics.
